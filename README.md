# üî¨ False Positive Calculator

A comprehensive Streamlit web application for understanding the relationship between test accuracy, disease prevalence, and false positive rates. This tool helps visualize how even highly accurate tests can produce surprising numbers of false positives when screening for rare conditions.

## üåü Features

### Interactive Parameters
- **Sensitivity**: Adjust the true positive rate (0-100%)
- **Specificity**: Adjust the true negative rate (0-100%)
- **Prevalence**: Set the disease/condition prevalence in the population
- **Population Size**: Define the total number of people being tested

### Comprehensive Metrics
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Probability that a positive test is truly positive
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Probability that a negative test is truly negative
- **False Discovery Rate (FDR)**: Proportion of positive results that are false positives
- **False Positive Rate**: Proportion of healthy people who test positive

### Rich Visualizations
- **Confusion Matrix Heatmap**: Visual representation of test outcomes
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Distribution of true/false positives and negatives
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Interactive chart showing how prevalence affects PPV
- **Real-time Updates**: All visualizations update instantly as you adjust parameters

### Educational Content
- Detailed interpretation guides
- Real-world example scenarios
- Export functionality to CSV
- Mathematical explanations of key concepts

- Optimizing fraud detection thresholds
- Balancing sensitivity vs. specificity in threat detection

### Quality Control
- Manufacturing defect detection
- Product testing and validation
- Statistical process control

### Research & Education
- Teaching Bayesian statistics
- Demonstrating the base rate fallacy
- Understanding conditional probability

## üéì Key Insights

The app demonstrates a critical statistical concept: **even with highly accurate tests (e.g., 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity), if the condition being tested is rare (low prevalence), the majority of positive results can be false positives.**

### Example Scenario
- **Test Accuracy**: 95% sensitivity, 95% specificity
- **Prevalence**: 1% (rare condition)
- **Result**: Only ~16% of positive tests are true positives
- **Implication**: 84% of positive results are false positives!

This phenomenon is crucial for understanding:
- Why confirmatory testing is important
- The limitations of mass screening programs
- How to interpret medical test results
- The importance of considering base rates (prevalence)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**: Web application framework
- **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/)**: Interactive visualizations
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Data manipulation
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**: Numerical computations

## üìñ Understanding the Metrics

### Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)
The probability that the test correctly identifies someone with the condition.
```
Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
```

### Specificity (True Negative Rate)
The probability that the test correctly identifies someone without the condition.
```
Specificity = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)
```

### Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
The probability that someone with a positive test actually has the condition.
```
PPV = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
```

### False Discovery Rate (FDR)
The proportion of positive test results that are false positives.
```
FDR = False Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) = 1 - PPV
```
